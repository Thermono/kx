GGAL_golicja_glodomeria:0 "Golicja i Głodomeria"
GAL_golicja_glodomeria_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also known simply as Galicia or Austrian Poland, was established in 1772 as a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland.  After initially strong Germanization, in 1861 Galicia gained autonomy with the national parliament and the government in the capital city of Lviv. In 1867, with the establishment of a dualistic monarchy, the provincial autonomy was extended. The Austrian government guaranteed that governors would be appointed from among local Poles. The local parliament 'Sejm Krajowy' had the right to pass laws on the national economy, communication, education and health. The Austrian authorities have not invested in the region for decades, which is why  Galicia was one of the poorest regions in Europe. Poles from other regions used to even maliciously refer to Galicia and Lodommeria as 'Golicja i Glodomeria', which would mean 'Nakedia and Hungeria'."
GAL_rural_society:0 "Rural Society"
GAL_rural_society_desc:0 "The Galician society consisted mainly of peasants and smallholders. Although the majority of the inhabitants lived in the villages, the fragmentation of land meant that agriculture was not very profitable."
GAL_minority_unrest:0 "Restless Minorities"
GAL_minority_unrest_desc:0 "Galicia was also divided ethnically and religiously. The largest group of 46 percent. were Roman Catholics (mainly Poles, but there was also a small community of German settlers). A slightly smaller group were Greek Catholics (42 percent). Most of them described themselves as Ukrainians or Ruthenians (sometimes contrasting both terms), but some of the inhabitants referred to themselves as 'tutejsi' or locals. The Jewish population also constituted a significant proportion (over 10 percent). From 1867, almost all power was in Polish hands, which only intensified the tensions. "
GAL_shattered_unity:0 "Shattered Political Unity"
GAL_shattered_unity_desc:0 "Thanks to its extensive autonomy, Galicia became the center of the Polish independence movement. Polish political parties and paramilitary organizations operated here, which were the basis of the Legions formed at the beginning of the 20th century. The armed organizations established during the war, however, did not win the independence or the unification of Galician lands with lands from other partitions. At present, confidence in Vienna is shaky, even though almost all legal political parties declare (most often apparently) their support for the monarchy."
GAL_golicja_glodomeria_2:0 "Golicja i Głodomeria"
GAL_golicja_glodomeria_desc:0 "tbd - very poor region, lack of funds from Vienna, Nakedia & Hungeria"

GAL_psl_victory:0 "PSL Victory"
GAL_psl_victory_desc:0 "The victory of the PSL will bring a new order to Galicia based on the hard work of a Galician farmer, Christian morality and Polish tradition."
GAL_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
GAL_land_reform_desc:0 "Galicia was the country with the highest percentage of people working in agriculture. At the same time, agriculture in Galicia was one of the least profitable in Europe. The reason for this was the simultaneous existence of thousands of farms so small that they could not feed themselves, and of enormous aristocratic estates. The land reform assumed the reduction of the latter and the distribution of confiscated land to smallholders."
GAL_credit_unions:0 "Credit Unions"
GAL_credit_unions_desc:0 "Frequently in foreign hands, banks cannot be trusted. The Polish peasant should benefit from credit institutions created especially for his needs. To this end, PSL will support the creation of a credit union modeled on the solutions introduced by F. W. Raiffeisen in Germany and Franciszek Stefczyk in Galicia."
GAL_industrial_crops_initiative:0 "Industrial Crops Initiative"
GAL_industrial_crops_initiative_desc:0 "A modern state requires a modern industry. Galicia needs an outlet for agricultural products. So we should encourage peasants to start growing plants and useful for the development of industry, such as flax, rape or hemp."
GAL_mass_electrification:0 "Mass Electrification"
GAL_mass_electrification_desc:0 "The modernization of the Galician economy requires the electrification of small towns and even villages. Despite the fact that it is a program for decades, the sooner it is launched, the sooner small towns will become centers of economic development, not only Krakow and Lviv, as has been the case so far."
GAL_church_state_relations:0 "Church & State Relations"
GAL_church_state_relations_desc:0 "The Polish peasant is religious. And very well. However, it is important to be clear. The relationship between the state and the church should be regulated unequivocally and definitively. Will the opinion of the clergy always be binding on the citizens of our country or will it be binding only in matters of faith? "
GAL_minority_outreach:0 "Minority Outreach"
GAL_minority_outreach_desc:0 "The Polish peasant has no evil intentions towards anyone. Peasants of other nationalities are equally exploited by the powerful of this world. The Polish peasant is also the host of this land. We must therefore clarify the relationship with minorities, even with those who were not always loyal to the Polish peasantry."
GAL_unicameralism:0 "Unicameralism"
GAL_unicameralism_desc:0 "A bicameral parliament is a form of class exploitation practiced by the aristocracy. The introduction of a unicameral parliament in which representatives of the peasants and nobility would sit on equal terms would make Galicia a fully democratic state."
GAL_administrative_reform:0 "Administrative Reform"
GAL_administrative_reform_desc:0 "The current administrative division is outdated and does not meet the needs of the Galician society. Administrative boundaries go back to the divisions of the eighteenth century and do not take into account other ethnic and economic conditions. People's activists such as Józef Buzek, Kazimierz Bartel or Bolesław Wysłouch presented a number of solutions to this problem. "
GAL_peoples_education:0 "People's Education"
GAL_peoples_education_desc:0 "One of the main problems plaguing the people of Galicia is illiteracy. It particularly affects the poor peasants who cannot afford to send their children even to free schools. For this reason, we will fund scholarships for talented peasants, and who knows, maybe we will discover talented self-taught people."
GAL_chlopomania:0 "Chłopomania"
GAL_chlopomania_desc:0 "The intelligentsia fascination with the peasantry was a common phenomenon at the beginning of the 20th century in Galicia. Noblemen, students and intellectuals marveled at the simple life of the farming community. Reviving this fascination will be a milestone in building the culture of a new Galician society."
GAL_peasants_guard:0 "Peasants' Guard"
GAL_peasants_guard_desc:0 "The army has so far been exclusively aristocratic. Time to break with it. The agrarian movement will seek to create an armed force composed of the Peasants. For this reason, it will be necessary to create new armed formations, such as Peasants' Guard, alongside the reformed army. In the future, these new formed formations will become the future army of peasant Galicia. "
GAL_obroncy_ojcowizny:0 "Obrońcy Ojcowizny"
GAL_obroncy_ojcowizny_desc:0 "The greatest duty of every Pole is to serve in defense of the Homeland. The Peasant Guard units will guard the country's borders and will become true 'Obrońcami Ojcowizny' (Defenders of Patrimony)"
GAL_kraj_wloscian:0 "Kraj Włościan"
GAL_kraj_wloscian_desc:0 "Our homeland has finally become the true mother of not only landlords and nobility, but also small farmers, farm workers and all honest working people. Old relics of social divisions are replaced by a sense of brotherly cooperation. Galicia has become a dream country of farmers (Kraj Włościan)."
GAL_ally_czechs:0 "Ally the Czechs"
GAL_ally_czechs_desc:0 "The Czechs, oppressed by the Germans, have always been our brothers. It's time to reach out to them and forget about past resentments and misunderstandings."
GAL_kordon_sokalski:0 "Kordon Sokalski"
GAL_kordon_sokalski_desc:0 "Not all national minorities were equally willing to cooperate and integrate. The Ukrainians from Eastern Lesser Poland turned out to be particularly unruly. In order to prevent contacts with their compatriots from Volhynia and the rest of Ukraine, a colonization campaign should be carried out on an ethnically mixed border. It is therefore necessary to place Polish peasant-colonists in order to separate a large groups of Ukrainians from each other."
GAL_ukrainian_cooperation:0 "Ukrainian Cooperation"
GAL_ukrainian_cooperation_desc:0 "The Ukrainians living in Galicia are valuable allies and cooperation with them brings mutual benefits. Unfortunately, cooperation with the government in Kiev is not always going as planned. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the mutual relations in a manner that is unequivocal and beneficial to all interested parties. "

GAL_chsr_victory:0 "ChSR Victory"

GAL_searching_coalition_partners:0 "Searching for Coalition Partners"
GAL_searching_coalition_partners_desc:0 "Enjoying the sympathy of the peasantry, the ChSR was lonely in parliament. So there were voices that we should seek support from other political parties in order to be able to carry out the desired reforms. "
GAL_parcellation_land:0 "Parcellation of Land"
GAL_parcellation_land_desc:0 "It is not fair that a hard-working peasant should have such a small farm that he cannot feed himself. Whereas the great aristocratic landlords owned areas of land so large that it would not be possible to fully comprehend it. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce limits on the owned arable land and distribute the surplus to those in need."
GAL_strike_usury:0 "Strike at Usury"
GAL_strike_usury_desc:0 "Bankers and greedy exploiters preyed on the naivety of the Polish peasantry. Interest of hundreds of percent ruined entire families. This must be stopped. We must cancel the unfairly charged percentage and ban this harmful practice. "
GAL_infrastructure_reform:0 "Infrastructure Reform"
GAL_infrastructure_reform_desc:0 "Communication in Galicia is extremely difficult. Roads are impassable after every prisoner of rain, and journeys between villages and towns are endlessly long. We must bear the costs of infrastructure development so that the peasant can go to the city and take advantage of the benefits of modern technology or medical care."
GAL_rural_industrial_cooperatives:0 "Rural-Industrial Cooperatives"
GAL_rural_industrial_cooperatives_desc:0 "The agricultural and infrastructural reform enables the harmonious cooperation of towns and villages. Peasants gain the possibility to quickly and easily sell the produced goods, while city dwellers will never have to fear hunger again."
GAL_folk_morality:0 "Folk Morality"
GAL_folk_morality_desc:0 "The presumption that poor and simple people are guided by moral principles is not fully supported by the truth.

Andrzej Huszno promotes with their teaching and example, valuable attitudes in Galicia and abroad."
GAL_chlop_wami:0 "Chłop z Wami"

GAL_christian_trade_unions:0 "Christian Trade Unions"
GAL_christian_trade_unions_desc:0 "All the poor, including city dwellers, should be taken care of. The best way for this would be to organize a Christian Trade Union that could represent workers to employers."

### Events ###
gal.1.t:0 "Galicia and Lodomeria Becomes Independent"
gal.1.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia Lodomeria sees herself independent. But we are a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours - and maybe we would do good seeking protection from Poland, the nation our territory has been taken from all these years ago."
gal.1.a:0 "Ask to formally join Poland. (Game Over)"
gal.1.b:0 "Galicia shall remain independent."

gal.2.t:0 "Galicia Seeks to Join Our Nation"
gal.2.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia Lodomeria sees herself independent. But being a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours, the newly independent nation feels her very existence threatened. A diplomatic envoy arrived today to discuss an incorporation of Galicia into Polish territory."
gal.2.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers."

gal.3.t:0 "Claiming the Bucovina"
gal.3.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, its southernmost province, the Bucovina, is home to many Romanians. Given the current confusion within the territory, we could relatively easily seize it in a swift manoeuvre."
gal.3.a:0 "Let us free our brothers."
gal.3.b:0 "Provoking the Poles is not wise."

gal.4.t:0 "Claiming East Galicia"
gal.4.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, the East is home to mostly Ukrainians. Given the current confusion within the territory, we could relatively easily seize it in a swift manoeuvre."
gal.4.a:0 "Let us free our brothers."
gal.4.b:0 "Provoking the Poles is not wise."

gal.5.t:0 "Romania Has Marched into the Bucovina"
gal.5.d:0 "An incorporation of a territory as large as Galicia was never expected to go smoothly. However what wasn't expected was meddling from the outside - Romanian troops have marched into the largely Romanian-speaking territory Bucovina, claiming the state as their own. Officials of the former Galician government have urged us to intervene."
gal.5.a:0 "This shall not stand. Retake what is ours!"
gal.5.b:0 "Let the Romanians have what speaks Romanian."

gal.6.t:0 "The Ukraine has Seized Eastern Galicia"
gal.6.d:0 "Kraków and Lwów are the most important cities of Galicia. The integration of the former has gone smoothly over the run of the last week, however the inhabitants of the mostly Ruthenian-speaking territories surrounding Lwow have, with aid of the Ukrainian military, seized the city. The city of Lwów is too important for Poland to just let it fall into the hands of another country."
gal.6.a:0 "This shall not stand. Retake what is ours!"
gal.6.b:0 "Ruthenians aren't Poles anyway."

gal.7.t:0 "Karl Albrecht Elected as King of Poland"
gal.7.d:0 "The current Governor of Galicia and Lodomeria, Karl Albrecht von Habsburg, has just been elected as the new King of Poland after an intensely contested vote. Karl Albrecht is expected to leave the nation early tomorrow to take up his new position as leader of the Polish people, and has left Jozef Haller von Hallenburg in charge of Galicia in his absence."
gal.7.a:0 "Wish him luck."

gal.psl1.t:0 "Agrarian Reform"
gal.psl1.d:0 "The idea of land reform was so common in Galicia that no political party in the Seym was openly against it. However, each political form had its own vision of how this reform was to proceed. The Social Democrats wanted to develop cooperatives, and the liberals and conservatives preferred to codify the regulations concerning agricultural cultivation. The head of the People's Party - Wincenty Witos had to reconcile various opposing factions in his own party. The party called for the division of large estates and the distribution of surplus land to small-scale peasants. The dispute, however, was whether the division should cover only farms with an area of 100 ha (which was Witos' original proposition ) or those already over 50 ha (as Jan Stapiński and Józef Putek argued). Witos' advisor  Jan Dąbski planned to determine the maximum size of the estates according to the quality of the soil.  There was also a problem who should be considered a smallholder farmer, owner of less than 20 ha or less than 10 ha. And the most important question is whether the reform would involve compensation from the state (as conservative activists of the peasant party wanted) or not (as progressive activists wanted). Ultimately, the party will adopt the following reform project:"
gal.psl1.a:0 "Divide large and medium-sized estates without compensation."
gal.psl1.b:0 "Divide large and medium-sized with compensation."
gal.psl1.c:0 "Jan Dąbski's proposal. Without compensation from the state."
gal.psl1.e:0 "Jan Dąbski proposal. With compensation from the state."

gal.psl2.t:0 "State-Church Relations"
gal.psl2.d:0 "State-Church relations were an extremely complicated problem for the People's Party. The majority of activists and voters were deeply religious. At the same time, the enormous land property of the church, the luxuries in the lives of some clergymen who taught about the virtues of poverty and humility, or even the politicization of the clergy irritated the poor people of Galicia. Wincenty Witos himself used to say, 'One should always obey the parish priest in matters of faith and never in political matters'. It was an extremely difficult issue to regulate the status of church properties with the agrarian reform (which was strongly demanded by Bolesław Koniecouch and Kazimierz Bartel). However, some activists of the People's Party (Like Fr. Kazimierz Kotula) not only opposed it but demanded that the church be given a role in the government."
gal.psl2.a:0 "Limit the economic and political role of the church"
gal.psl2.b:0 "The Church must maintain an economic position and have a role in politics"

gal.psl3.t:0 "Ukrainian Problem"
gal.psl3.d:0 "In the case of national minorities, the peasant parties initially wanted to ensure their rights to free development. The peasant roots of the Ukrainian nation aroused strong interest in the Ukrainian question in the people's movement. The activity of Ukrainians in the field of social activity or the beliefs of the so far undecided masses, over time, began to cause concern among PSL activists. Stanisław Miłkowski called 'the Polish peasant to cooperate with the Ruthenian peasant to finally unite brotherly nations by gradually blurring the differences between the Slavic nations'. At the same time, he was in favor of banning the separtist activity of the Ukrainian intelligentsia. Wincenty Witos was even more radical and hostile to the Ukrainians. In his opinion, the Polish peasant should help the Polish nobility maintain their estates in areas inhabited by Ukrainians. There was even an idea to limit land reform in ethnically mixed territories."
gal.psl3.a:0 "Support the Ukrainian peasants in their fight against the landowners."
gal.psl3.b:0 "Limit the land reform in areas inhabited by Ukrainians."

gal.psl4.t:0 "Administrative Reform"
gal.psl4.d:0 "The territorial division of Galicia, introduced in 1854, was not adapted to modern needs. It did not take into account the changed economic conditions, rural development or ethnic changes. Józef Buzek therefore proposed transforming Galicia into a federation of self-governing cantons (similar to the Swiss ones), which, in his opinion, would ease national tensions and improve the quality of administration. Wincenty Witos, on the other hand, wanted to extend the administrative boundaries of the counties dominated by Poles so that the Polish population would gain a numerical advantage in the vast number of local government units."
gal.psl4.a:0 "Division into egalitarian cantons."
gal.psl4.b:0 "Division into large territorial units and excluding Ukrainians from local government."

gal.psl5.t:0 "A New Political Course"
gal.psl5.d:0 "The latest meeting of Party leaders promises to be very intense. The peasant party took a more progressive course, contrary to the previous policy of its leader - Wincenty Witos. A significant number of activists believe that the time has come for a change in the position of a leader and for Witos to resign as a political leader. The main critics of Witos are the leader of the peasant progressivists Bolesław Wysłouch and the peasant activist-professor from Lwów, Kazimeirz Bartel."
gal.psl5.a:0 "Wincenty Witos will remain the head of the party."
gal.psl5.b:0 "Bolesław Wysłouch will provide stabilization."
gal.psl5.c:0 "Kazimierz Bartel will bring Galicia into a new era."

gal.psl6.t:0 "Bolesław Wysłouch Resigns."
gal.psl6.d:0 "The deteriorating health forced Bolesław Wysłouch to withdraw from participation in public life. However, there was a problem of who would take over his position. The outgoing leader would like to indicate that he should be replaced by Kazimierz Bartel. However, he is not the only one candidate - Wincenty Witos would like to return to his former position."
gal.psl6.a:0 "Wincenty Witos"
gal.psl6.b:0 "Kazimierz Bartel"

gal.psl7.t:0 "Chłopomania"
gal.psl7.d:0 "The political situation of the region led many intellectuals to believe that the only alternative to decadence is getting back to the folk roots: moving out of large cities and mixing with simple men. This belief is called 'Chłopomania' (Peasantmania) in Polish and was especially popular in Galicia before the Great War. The current effective policy has led to the revival of this idea."
gal.psl7.a:0 "Great."
